GreenThread runs on bare-metal Ubuntu servers with NVIDIA datacenter GPUs.

## Hardware

- **GPUs**: NVIDIA datacenter GPUs (A100, H100, L40S, etc.)
- **System RAM**: Enough to cache model weights for fast wake — at minimum, match your total GPU VRAM
- **Storage**: Local NVMe drives for the model cache directory — one drive per GPU recommended

## Software

- **OS**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (required)
- **NVIDIA driver**: Version 590 or later
- **GPU Direct Storage**: Required for high-throughput weight transfers
- **Python**: 3.12 with development headers (`python3.12-dev`)
- **Root access**: Installation requires `sudo`

## Licence key

You need a GreenThread licence key to install and run the platform. Keys use the format `gthread_xxx` and are issued by your GreenThread account team.

Contact [sales@greenthread.ai](mailto:sales@greenthread.ai) to get started.

## Network

GreenThread listens on port **8080** by default. Ensure this port is accessible to your application clients.

During installation and model downloads, outbound HTTPS access is required to:

- `licence.greenthread.ai` — licence validation and installer
- `huggingface.co` — model weight downloads
